	  “As people spin faster and faster in the pursuit of merely personal happiness, they become exhausted in the futile effort of chasing themselves.”
– Andrew Delbanco
“All happiness or unhappiness solely depends upon
 the quality of the object to which we are attached by love.”
“Happiness consists more in conveniences of pleasure that occur everyday than in great pieces of good fortune that happen but seldom.”
This happiness are only come from parents.
“Happiness is not an ideal of reason, but of imagination.”
“To be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness.”
so give respect to Aai BABA.
